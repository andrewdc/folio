		<p>
			At Arcoro, our time tracking application ExakTime had a quick set-up
			flow that was clunky and due for a refresh. The sign up flow needed
			to be self-serve, and minimize friction for the user. Additionally,
			it needed an aesthetic refresh that was on brand, and built
			excitement as the user was onboarded to ExakTime.

		<p>
			Time off management was a critical feature for our users at Arcoro.
			Our administrators needed to be able to create and assign time off
			plans, our supervisors needed to approve requests for their teams,
			and our crew member users needed to be able to easily see their time
			off balances, and make requests.
		</p>
		<Challenge>
			<div slot="challenge">
				<p>
					Time off plan tiers are incredibly complex, having many
					conditional rules. It requires a lot of attention to detail
					to avoid mistakes with how time is calculated between tiers.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div slot="solution">
				<p>
					I designed an intuitive system for administrators to create
					complex tier-based plans. The math for each tier was
					pre-calculated and filled based on a previous tier, allowing
					the admins to clearly understand each segment, and rapidly
					add tiers a step at a time without making errors.
				</p>
			</div>
		</Challenge>
		<p>
			For supervisors and crew members, we created a simple visual system
			to easily make, approve, and modify time off requests via our mobile
			application. Plan types, balances, and statuses were easily
			understandable at a glance, streamlining the process for all users.

		<p>
			I was tapped, along with two other developers to build a
			company-wide design system for PowerSchool from the ground up. It is
			a component library built with Sass, Angular 2, and Polymer, and
			consumed by several applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the process our team overhauled our UX/UI library, enuring that
			all existing and future interfaces were accessible and up to WCAG,
			and ADA standards.
		</p>
		<p>
			The system utilizes a flexible theme system, where we can provide
			the base design for the organization, but also allow each team the
			flexibility to customize and extend the library to fit their
			application's unique needs.

		<p>
			At Incomm, I teamed up with another designer to build a modular Sass
			design system. At the time, design systems were only just begining
			to gain popularity. We built this from the ground up with some
			innovative tools, which allowed any application to customize the
			theme of our components, but then also have a safe fallback to our
			base UX design.
		</p>
		<p>
			This system (which we called Nxsass) allowed us to create and
			support several teams and applications across our organization.
			Also, we had a great area for prototyping user experience, and
			interface designs.

		<p>
			In addition to the web UI and UX, I designed report templates that

		<p>
			My UX design process is highly collaborative. I work from early
			research with the users and stakeholders, listening to their needs,
			asking questions, and taking notes. I then spend time thinking
			through what their story looks like.
		</p>
		<p>
			I work with my team, to further define and clarify the user journey
			and begin conceptualizing ideas of how to help them reach their
			goals. Nothing is sacred. Ideas are meant to be questioned,
			criticized, and sometimes scrapped.
		</p>
		<p>
			I progress through this cycle between the user and product team to
			refine ideas until we can present and test early prototypes and
			gather further feedback. Even at this stage, nothing is off the
			table. The purpose is to prove our design model before we commit to
			more time consuming development.
		</p>
		<p>
			A final design begins to take shape. Whether this results in Figma
			comps, or functional web prototyping depends on the needs of our
			team. Development may begin. However, the cycle of testing and
			listening to users continues, with the goal of refining and
			delivering proven and pleasant results.
