			Though an older project stylistically (2011), the work I did on
			Practice Performer for Press Ganey demonstrates solving very
			complicated information-heavy interfaces.

					Health system satisfaction and quality metrics are composed
					of overwhelming quantities of measured data points.

			<div slot="solution">
				<p>
					I help design and develop a sophisticated and interactive
					'target' UI to distill categorical performance information.
					Metric indicators were given color, shape, and progress
					indicators, allowing the user to understand areas above or
					below performance benchmarks at a glance.

		</Challenge>
		<p>
			In addition to the web UI and UX, I designed report templates that
			were automatically generated by our platform. They shared a design
			aesthetic, and focused on further highlighting key metrics to help
			health professionals understand and implement improvements for their
			health populations.
