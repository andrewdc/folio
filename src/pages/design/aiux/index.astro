		<h2>AI Navigation Assistant</h2>
		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<div class="detail-block">
			<div>
				<p>
					As the Arocro HR management platform grew we needed to address <strong>
						how our users would navigate
					</strong> our extensive product and its additional modules.
				</p>
				<p>
					I spent time researching, designing, and testing a
					traditional navigation system which could accommodate an
					expanding portfolio of features, while being intuitive and
					discoverable by our users.

				<p>
					However, during this work, useful AI tools emerged.
					Our team felt it was critical to consider how we could integrate AI
					to help this problem and benefit our users.

					Artificial intelligence often flips the way that users
					interact with computers. Traditional interactions usually
					function like steering a computer toward a certain goal or
					building an idea from blocks. However, with AI, the user
					describes the goal (or final form) and the AI system
					attempts to build it from its model and training.
				</p>
				<p>
					This fundamental shift in thinking was pivotal to this
					feature.

		<Challenge>
			<div slot="challenge">
				<p>
					We knew users could easily become overwhelmed as a complicated platform
					added features. Many functions could be lost or buried in a
					large system.</p>
					<p>AI interactions pose unique challenges: they are new, their
					reasoning can be unpredictable, and occasionally their
					results are unreliable.
					</p>
					<strong>Hypothesis:</strong>
					<em>
						Could we implement AI in a helpful way that could build trust and benefit users?
					</em>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div slot="solution">
				<p>
					I designed our AI experience around the following principals derived from user research:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Keep AI optional</strong> for the user</li>
						<li><strong>AI should be focused</strong> and narrow in scope</li>
						<li><strong>The experience should guide</strong> the user by suggestion</li>
						<li><strong>Users verify</strong> AI responses before taking action</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
		</Challenge>
		<p>As mentioned above, I surveyed concerns internally and externally around application complexity, user overload, and specific issues important to how people respond to AI in applications. This research resulted in the principles explained in my solution below.</p>
		<h3>The Goal: Building User Trust</h3>
		<p><strong>Keep AI features optional:</strong> When testing this tool it was clear AI was helpful for discovering unknown actions, but also more cumbersome than traditional navigation for functions users already understood. Therefore, our assistant was designed and trained to <em>aid the user in navigation and feature discovery, but not to replace</em> traditional navigation. In order to build trust, it is important for users to maintain the ability to choose.</p>
		<p><strong>AI should be focused:</strong> The AI assistant was given a very limited scope (initially), only being trained how to direct users to application features. This allowed us to minimize unexpected results. If asked questions outside the scope of its knowledge, the AI was trained to give friendly responses directing the user back to its limited capabilities.</p>
		<p><strong>The experience guides the user:</strong>
			Because AI interactions are still new, some users may be uncertain where to start, or what they can ask. I designed our AI experience to include friendly prompt suggestions,
			gently guiding the user toward things they could try, and demonstrating different ways they could ask questions.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Users verify AI responses:</strong>
			Once the AI assistant responded, the user was given the choice to
			<em>confirm</em> and follow the suggestion, <em>try something else</em>, or <em>exit</em>. For instance, if asked, <em>"How can I update Alison's profile image?"</em> the system would respond, <em>"You can update Alison's profile image by editing her user page. Would you like to go there now?"</em>
		</p>
		<p>I added this validation step to <strong>keep choice in the hands of our users</strong>. It allowed them to verify results, experiment, and choose how the AI could help, rather
			than having it automatically make hidden decisions for them.
		</p>

		<h3>User Testing Feedback</h3>

		<p>
			Feedback from users was surprisingly positive, though usage metrics were varied. As noted in the 'optional principle,' once a feature was discovered via AI, user motivation to return to the tool dropped. This was expected behavior, but it leaves room for improvement.
		</p>
		<p>Likely improvements could revolve around carefully expanding the AI's scope, functionality, and placement throughout our application UI. Perhaps AI could learn from user patterns, and begin to generate and suggest helpful prompts (custom action buttons) based on usage data. Or you can imagine the interface being able to explain and perform functions, rather than simply directing the user to locations.</p>
		<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
		<p>As this feature took shape, it was clear AI could effectively deliver an
			interface to the user, but there are still many areas for improvement.  This is an exciting and monumental shift in
			how we should consider UX design, and will be vital to software design moving into the future. </p>

		<h2>AI and User Experience</h2>
		<p><em>A quick thought...</em></p>
		<p>
			It's impossible to look forward in any field and ignore the impact
			of AI. For user experience designers, <strong>
				it is vital to advocate for AI patterns and tools that benefit
				and enhance human lives
			</strong>. With careful proactive thought, we can better adapt to
			this exciting emerging technology.
		</p>

			For more of my thoughts, I recently wrote a short post about how
			designers should approach AI on LinkedIn:
