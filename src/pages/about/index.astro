		<h2>My Design Philosophy</h2>
		<p>
			I've always believed that design is where <em>art</em> and
			<em>usefulness</em> meet. The key in design is to <em>
				care about people
			</em>, learn what they need, and serve them in an enjoyable way.
			While good design can solve a problem, great design brings
			enjoyment.
		</p>
		<p>
			This only happens through empathy, listening, and genuine
			understanding. Sometimes this means a design needs to disappear â€” <em
			>
				to get out of the way
			</em> so people can get things done. Other times it's adding a richness
			to an experience that leaves you delighted.
		</p>
		<p>
			In every case, <strong>
				design is about making the world better for people.
			</strong>
